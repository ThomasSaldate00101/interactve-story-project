A person in your group ask “What are these things?” \n“These pods are to eliminate any harmful bacteria,” the doctor states, “then we will show you all to your new homes, It's just a safety procedure we hope you understand.”As you and the other people enter these strange devices the hatch closes and then you feel the small pod began freeze you into a deep sleep.\n When you awaken from your frozen slumber the pod opens up and you fall to the floor shaky from being asleep for who knows how long, as you look around you notice that your pod was the only one that opened. Still shaky, you try to open other pods, but to no avail as none were seeming to open. “They malfunctioned,” said a voice from the entrance of the room, “it seems we were the only lucky ones to survive these pods.",

You pull a lever, opening the large gate into the unknown. As you and kailum leave the cave sheltered the bunker you see a desolate place, where trees once vibrant with life left with nothing but the trees bark. And houses have been ruined by the bombs from so long ago. As you and your friend wander the ruins you another person in strange clothing.

You both proceed towards towards her slowly. As you near the stranger they notice you and point a strangely crafted weapon towards you.“Who are you guys, raiders thinkin they got the jump on me?” the stranger asks through a masked voice.\n “Wait, don't shoot!” you reply “we are from the bunker in the hills, we were the only survivors from some form of deep sleep.”\n “Oh,” they say in a calmer tone, “your just a bunkey we rarely ever see any of you people anymore.” the stranger then put their weapons away and remove their mask. “Names maddy, im part of a settlement up north. If you want, you can tag along and get you a spot to rest.” \n“That would be nice cause its really our only option right now” kailum says to you.“Sure, let's get going, we do need to get our bearings of this world anyways” You reply, so you explore the area with maddy and collect supplies, then the three of you make your way to your new companion to her settlement.",

We gotta get down there now!” you and your companions run to the town. As you arrive the town seems to have been ransacked and destroyed. This must been raiders, it must have been. She then proceeds to form of a security room and she looks through the towns camera system. They showed what maddy had suspected, as raiders ransacked the town and capture the townspeople. “We have to get them back.” maddy says coldly, “and you two are going to assist me in doing so.”\n “Seems like your not really given us much a choice” cailum sternly says. \n“Well, to be fair she was willing to help us, so it's only fair that we should do the same.” you state. Maddy guides you to their armory and then ride off to the raiders hideout in a vehicle hand crafted by her.as night falls, you, maddy, and kailum arrive at the hideout. “What's the plan to get in?” kailum asks maddy.\n “we could either sneak in try a lil bit of force and ram the front gates.”",

You then proceed to create a hole in the wall with some tools you brought along. When you three get inside you sneak through and are met with a giant room with group of people next to the captured townspeople. \n“That's the towns leader,” maddy whispers, “what's he doing?” One of the raiders was handing the towns leader a satchel. The raiders rough voiced boomed through the room \n“Pleasure doin business with ya herschel, I knew you would come around sooner or later.” \n “you gave them to the raiders for some pocket change!” maddy yelled in anger \n“It was either them or me” he replied coldly, “you can only look out for one person: your self,” he stares at the three of you for a moment, then turns to slag \n“do how you see fit with these three, slag.”\n I'm feelin generous, so I will give you three welps a chance, it's either you may join our gang, or we gun you down.
